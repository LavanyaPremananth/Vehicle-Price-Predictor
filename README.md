# Linear Regression Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating a linear regression model for predicting selling prices in the used car market. The linear regression algorithm is applied to a dataset containing various features such as year, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, engine specifications, and maximum power.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** The goal is to develop a predictive model for used car selling prices using linear regression. The project involves data visualization, statistical analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

- **Domain-specific Area and Objectives:**
  - *Domain:* Used Car Market
  - *Objectives:* Predict selling prices based on various features. Investigate trends and relationships in the used car market data.

## Dataset Description

- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of information related to used cars, including details such as year of manufacture, selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, engine specifications, and maximum power.

- **Source:** [[Provide the source of the dataset, e.g., Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv](#)
